# 🛠️ Helpdesk & Ticket Management System (Django + DRF + Celery)

A **Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)** based backend API for a simple Helpdesk & Ticket Management System.  
This project demonstrates **authentication, ticket management, escalation alerts with Celery, and API documentation**.  

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Authentication & User Management
- User registration, login, logout, profile update, delete account.
- Roles:
  - **User** → Raise tickets, view own tickets.  
  - **Agent** → Assigned tickets, update status, resolve.  
  - **Admin** → Full access (manage users, tickets, escalations).  

### 🎫 Ticket Management
- Users:
  - Create a ticket → title, description, priority (`low/medium/high`), status (`open/in-progress/resolved/closed`).
  - View own tickets.  
- Agents:
  - View assigned tickets.
  - Update status, add comments/updates.  
- Admins:
  - View all tickets.
  - Assign/reassign tickets to agents.
  - Delete tickets.  

### ⏰ Escalation & Alerts (Celery)
- Escalates tickets if not updated/resolved in defined timeframe:
  - High → **1 hr**, Medium → **4 hrs**, Low → **24 hrs**.
- Escalation flow:
  - Status auto-updated to **escalated**.
  - Email alert sent to **Admin + Ticket Creator** (using console/email backend for demo).
- Powered by **Celery + Redis** for async processing.

### 🔎 Search & Filtering
- Search tickets by → `title`, `status`, `priority`, `assigned_to`.
- Search users with computed field:  
  `nameEmail = "FirstName LastName - Email"`

### 🔐 Permissions & Security
- **Users** → Only own tickets.  
- **Agents** → Only assigned tickets.  
- **Admins** → Full access.  
- Enforced using **DRF permissions**.

### 📑 Documentation

- Clear request/response examples for each endpoint.
